# Bitcoin Price Prediction with MLFLOW
## Overview

This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using machine learning models and track experiments with MLflow. It leverages historical Bitcoin price data, preprocesses it, and trains a model to make future price predictions. The project is structured to ensure reproducibility and efficient tracking of model performance.

## Key Steps in the Project

- Data Collection: Load historical Bitcoin price data from the Tiingo API.

- Data Preprocessing: Normalize and structure data for model training.

- Model Training: Train a neural network model using a limited number of epochs.

- Experiment Tracking with MLflow: Log parameters, metrics, and model artifacts.

- Model Evaluation: Assess performance using validation metrics.

- Model Saving & Loading: Save the trained model and reload it for inference.

## Project Limitations

- Limited Training Resources: The model is trained with a small number of epochs due to resource constraints, which may impact prediction accuracy.

- Data Constraints: Performance is dependent on the availability and quality of Bitcoin price data.

- Feature Simplicity: The model does not incorporate external factors like market sentiment or economic indicators.
